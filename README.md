# XENSIV™ Radar presence detection

## Overview

The XENSIV™ Radar Presence Detection library detects both macro and micro movements in a configurable range using the data acquired by XENSIV™ FMCW radar sensor.
It uses the Sensor-DSP library that provides signal processing functions required to support the implementation of presence detection algorithm.

The user can configure the operation mode:

* Macro only
* Micro only
* Macro and micro
* Micro after macro

The minimum and maximum range detection can be configured.

The sensitivity level of each mode can be adjusted by changing the thresholds levels. 
   


## Features

* Initialization of presence detection algorithm
* Configuration of presence detection algorithm parameters
* Ability to detect micro-movements
* Generation of presence detection events
